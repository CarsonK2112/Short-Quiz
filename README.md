# Short-Quiz


This short quiz is 5 questions long and set to a 60 second timer.

There are 25 possible points, points are only awarded for correct answers and 5 seconds will be deducted for wrong answers.

Once a player finishes the quiz, they will have the opportunity to input their initials.

Once the player clicks the submit button, their initials and their score will be displayed onscreen. Consecutive players will have their initials and score added to the side.

In lieu of regular buttons radio buttons were used to provide a more convenient multiple choice selection. This created a unique challenge but using the .checked method I was able to mark correct answers.

In the future I will utilize a regular timer instead of setting a timer interval with a numeric value that required more coding to be done.

As I am behind in coding I chose not to style this particular assignment.
